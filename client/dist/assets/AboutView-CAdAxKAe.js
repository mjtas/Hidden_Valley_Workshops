I spend my time completing building projects around the property, I bake artisan sourdough bread, and I have a large garden that produces all of our fruit and vegetables. </li><li class="main-li">The direction of my life changed in my Honours year of politics at Melbourne University. I read a book called The Subsistence Perspective and decided that instead of living in the city and continuing my academic studies I wanted to learn as many practical skills as possible and live a more grounded life in the country. I did a Carpentry and Joinery apprenticeship, bought a 3/4 acre block in Hobart and set it up to produce as much of our food as possible. I gained a lot of experience on the way, starting with a large permaculture fruit and vegetable garden using chook tractors, as well as keeping ducks, chooks, pigs and dairy goats. </li><li class="main-li">Living on a large stunning property was always the ultimate goal, so when Hidden Valley came up for sale I fully renovated our house in Hobart before selling up and starting all over again using the lessons I had learnt to set up more efficient systems for food production. I have researched all my subjects thoroughly and I am very keen to share what I have learnt and put into practice with others.</li></ul></div><div class="main-right"><div class="main-opaque"><img class="about-img" src="'+t+'" alt="Hidden Valley"></div></div></div><div class="block"><div class="main-left"><h2>About Hidden Valley</h2><ul class="main-text"><li class="main-li">Hidden Valley is a private 280 acre property bordering the Great Western Tiers Conservation Area. It has spectacular views and lies 750 metres above sea level just past the Liffey Falls turn off on Highland Lakes Road. Only 20 minutes from Deloraine and under an hour from Launceston or Devonport, it is an old grazing property with paddocks dominated by native grasses and large areas of rainforest. There are two creeks that run over the property, a waterfall, and a sandstone cave.</li></ul></div><div class="main-right"><div class="main-opaque"><img class="about-img" src="'+n+'" alt="Hidden Valley"></div></div></div></div></div>',1),d=[l];function c(u,p,h,m,g,v){return i(),a("div",r,d)}const f=e(o,[["render",c]]);export{f as default};
