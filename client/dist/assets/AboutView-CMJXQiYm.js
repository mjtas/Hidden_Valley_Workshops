I decided to focus my life around producing my own food and doing things for myself about 15 years ago, and in that time I have learnt a lot! </li><li class="main-li">A healthy diet is one consisting mainly of fruit and vegetables, and I have learnt to focus on growing all the fruit and vegetables my family needs in the most efficient way possible. I also do all kinds of building projects around the home which improves the quality of our lives, such as building a play-set and mud kitchen for the kids. I also bake artisan sourdough bread, which is much cheaper and healthier than buying bread and gives us so much joy.</li><li class="main-li">When I’m not doing things around the place, I’m in front of the fire researching my topics of interest and planning for the future. I am so passionate about this way of life I’ve found and excited to be part of helping others live happy, joyful and meaningful lives around the home.</li></ul></div><div class="main-right"><div class="main-opaque"><img class="about-img" src="'+n+'" alt="Hidden Valley"></div></div></div><div class="block"><div class="main-left"><h2>About Hidden Valley</h2><ul class="main-text"><li class="main-li">Hidden Valley is a private 280 acre property bordering the Great Western Tiers Conservation Area. It has spectacular views and lies 750 metres above sea level just past the Liffey Falls turn off on Highland Lakes Road. Only 20 minutes from Deloraine and under an hour from Launceston or Devonport, it is an old grazing property with paddocks dominated by native grasses and large areas of rainforest. There are two creeks that run over the property, a waterfall, and a sandstone cave.</li></ul></div><div class="main-right"><div class="main-opaque"><img class="about-img" src="'+t+'" alt="Hidden Valley"></div></div></div></div></div>',1),d=[r];function c(h,u,m,f,p,v){return i(),e("div",l,d)}const y=a(o,[["render",c]]);export{y as default};
