                <h3>Garden Design</h3>
                <li class="main-li">I have designed many edible gardens including one using permaculture principles, another one with high raised beds, and here the Hidden Garden is modelled on a traditional french potager and the Courtyard Garden is a pure Charles Dowding No Dig design. I also love flowers and have included many perennials, annuals, climbers and of course roses in my gardens. </li>
                <li class="main-li">Having set-up my own 3/4 acre block in Hobart for self-sufficient food production (including dairy, meat, eggs, fruit and vegetables) I can help you design your own plan for becoming more self-sufficient. I have learnt many lessons the hard way and look forward to saving others the money and heartache involved by helping you plan efficient and sensible systems to suit your block and lifestyle.</li>
                <li class="main-li">I believe our gardens can be expressions of who we are, they can be works of art, or they can be all about efficient food production. I’ll design the garden you want and one that will suit your needs.</li>

                <li class="main-li">You might want some help sorting out your sourdough. You might want some building advice on how to build a garden fence, greenhouse, chook house or any other DIY project you have planned. I’m here to help get you organised and get you started, whether that means telling you what tools you need, showing you the skills you need to get the job done, or working with you until you are confident enough to do it alone. </li>
