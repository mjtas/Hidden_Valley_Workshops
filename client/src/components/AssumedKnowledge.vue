        <li class="main-li">I assume you know to cut on the waste side of the line, so that you leave the line on when you cut to the measurement.</li>
        <li class="main-li">I assume you can cut a straight line within 1mm of square with a circular saw (most of the time!).</li>
        <li class="main-li">I assume you know to always pre-drill your holes 2/3 the depth of the screw.</li>
        <li class="main-li">I teach all of these skills in my building skills workshops, along with a general introduction to hand and power tools so if youâ€™re feeling lost then come along and learn the basics or build on the basics with me in person!</li>
